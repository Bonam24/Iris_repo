About the Repo:
The Repo for comparing  the accuracy score of using different number of hidden layers of different models and their analysis.
My analysis suggests that increasing the number of hidden layers of the model decreases the accuracy.
This is because for relatively simpler problems like this one putting a lot of hidden layers leads to overfitting. Adding more hidden layers will only increase the accuracy for complex problems but will reduce the accuracy for simpler problems because of overfitting.
My accuracy score was 100 for c(50,3),  100% for  c(20,16,10,5) and 96.66% for  c(30,24,20,18,16,14,12,8,6,3).
